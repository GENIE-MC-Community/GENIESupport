## Checking out a tag

When first checking out this package, you will have the `HEAD` version of the
`master` branch. Get a specific tagged release by checking out the tag into a
branch like so:

    git checkout -b R-2_10_10.0-br R-2_10_10.0

This will checkout _tag_ `R-2_10_10.0` into _branch_ `R-2_10_10.0-br`. You want
to checkout into a branch so you are not in a "detached `HEAD`" state.


## Current tags

* `R-2_10_10.0`: Enable minuit2 when building ROOT. Also turn off debug
builds by default - users should now add a `-d/--debug` flag to build
with debugging symbols (impacts Pythia8 (not used yet) and ROOT).
* `R-2_10_6.0`: Use GitHub now to store Pythia6 files.
* `R-2_10_2.0`: Optional disabling of RooMUHistos and fix for LHAPDF 5.9 on
gcc 5.
* `R-2_9_0.1`: Bugfix patch to `R-2_9_0.0` that correctly sets the `$GSLINC`
environment variable.
* `R-2_9_0.0`: Minor changes to `R-2_8_6.3`. Intended for use with GENIE 2.9.0.
* `R-2_8_6.3-no-LHAPDF6`: Minor changes to `R-2_8_6.3`; No longer supporting
building LHAPDF6 and Boost.
* `R-2_8_6.3-last-LHAPDF6`: Minor changes to `R-2_8_6.3` (new command argument
parsing, documentation); Last tag to support building LHAPDF6 and Boost.
* `R-2_8_6.3`: Add a test script to check a few different build permutations 
and flags.
* `R-2_8_6.2`: Add a verbose flag to also print log info to stdout; check for 
exit codes when building packages and exit if they fail.
* `R-2_8_6.1`: Compliant with GENIE 2.8.6; builds 
[RooMUHistos](https://github.com/ManyUniverseAna/RooMUHistos) using the `HEAD`
of `master` correctly.
